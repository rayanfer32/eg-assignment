### Overview
Welcome to the Front-End React Interview Assignment! In this assignment, you will create
an application that displays articles. The purpose of the assignment is to assess your skills in
building front-end applications using React.
We have created a simple REST API that you should use for fetching the articles. There are
two endpoints:
1. https://ps-dev-1-partnergateway.patientsky.dev/assignment/articles
2. https://ps-dev-1-partnergateway.patientsky.dev/assignment/articles/{id}
The first endpoint returns a list of all the available articles, while the second endpoint
returns the article with the given id. Only the second endpoint will contain the full text of
the article. Both endpoints return data in Json format.
Your task is to build a React application that renders these articles in a visually appealing
manner.


### Requirements
DONE - 1. The application must be made with React and Typescript.
DONE - 2. There should be a front page that shows all the available articles. From this page it
should be possible to open any article to view its full text.
DONE - 3. Implement state management to handle the rendering of articles.
DONE - 4. Implement error handling for cases such as failed data fetching or rendering issues


### Guidelines
1. Time Allotted: Maximum 8 hours. Spending more time on the assignment will not
result in extra points.
2. Submission: Push your assignment to GitHub and share the repo.
3. Documentation: Include a brief documentation file explaining your approach, the
technologies used, any challenges faced, and how you tackled them.
4. Evaluation Criteria: Your assignment will be evaluated based on code quality,
adherence to requirements, user interface design, state management
implementation, error handling, and overall understanding of React.js concepts.
Please contact us if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the
assignment. Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your work!
